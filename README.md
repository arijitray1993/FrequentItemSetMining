# Python code for frequent item-set mining

Description: Mine co-occuring items in a list of transactions with frequency greater than support parameter, sigma, and item set size greater than another parameter, N. 

## How to run code:

`python analyze2.py --sigma <sigma> --N <N>`

`<sigma>` and `<N>` are integers like 4 and 3 respectively. 

If you just run python analyze2.py without any arguments, it runs with a default of sigma=4 and N=3. 

Hence,

`python analyze2.py --sigma 4 --N 3` 

and

`python analyze2.py` 

have the same result.
